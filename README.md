# ossync-sh
modified config file for oss server in shanghai
Please pull all original files from https://github.com/lanbaba/Ossyncone/archive/master.zip
Because of Aliyun OSS DNS change you have to do some modification about the "HOST" and also import necessary python os module.
Replace HOST with your OSS server's place if your OSS is not in Shanghai.
